<p style="color:white; font-size: 11pt; width: 500px; text-align: left; align-content: left;">Dreams are meant people who work towards achieving them. I do not remember if I heard it from a random video or a movie I was watching as a kid but it was stuck my head all the time. My name is Prajval Balakavi and for some time, I have been planning to pursue sports medicine and I started moving towards my goal by taking the medical pathway in highschool and then focusing on Kinesiology and Psychology.After college I plan to work in residency and gain some experience until I am good enough to be a sports medicine doctor on my own. Ever since I was a kid, I enjoyed playing sports and running around in the sun whether I was kicking the ball or throwing it. As I started to age throughout my childhood, I started researching about the body in order to enhance performance and eventually I developed a passion for sports medicine. I want to help people perform better in sports without worrying about injury and skipping on playing time.</p>
<br>
<p style="color:white; font-size: 11pt; width: 500px; text-align: left; align-content: left;">The medical field is for those who are responsible, and resourceful and fortunatley these traits fit me. I am also accurate, serious, self-motovated, and a team player.What seperates me from the rest is that I am really good at taking critiscim and even ask for it very often if I do something wrong or perform not as well. In high school I have maintained a 4.0+ GPA while playing football and track and field at a varsity level. After finishing my medical related electives, I went to several sports medicine internships to get a better understanding of what the field really is like. I went to the STEM fair 2 times and the first time I placed 9th out of 440 and the second time I placed 15th out of 600. </p>
<br>
<p style="color:white; font-size: 11pt; width: 500px; text-align: left; align-content: left;">I have learned that I had potential to suceed in the field of sports science because of my experience in varsity level sports. At varsity level, the competition is much tougher and rigourous which leads to more of my teammates being injured. Although I was not a doctor at that team, I gave lots of advice and tips which ended up working for them. Their problems were ultimatley fixed by a doctor but I am proud of myself for helping. In high school, I also noticed thta many people tried to take a lot of hard classes without any knowledge in order to get into a good college. I was not like, I also discovered I do not get pressured easily. I took the classes I beleived I was capable of doing and I found myself much happier than others. This experience also revealed I am a self motivated person since I took these classes only for my own benefit and learning without worrying about what colleges or others think. In conclusion, I have a passion for sports medicine and I want to help people perform better without the worry about injuries. Thank you for reading my "life story" and feel free to explore the rest of the website. </p>
